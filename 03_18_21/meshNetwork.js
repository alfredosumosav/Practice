/*
You wrote a trendy new messaging app, MeshMessage, to get around flaky cell 
phone coverage.

Instead of routing texts through cell towers, your app sends messages via the 
phones of nearby users, passing each message along from one phone to the next 
until it reaches the intended recipient. (Don't worryâ€”the messages are encrypted 
while they're in transit.)

Some friends have been using your service, and they're complaining that it takes 
a long time for messages to get delivered. After some preliminary debugging, you 
suspect messages might not be taking the most direct route from the sender to 
the recipient.

Given information about active users on the network, find the shortest route for 
a message from one user (the sender) to another (the recipient). Return an array 
of users that make up this route.

Your network information takes the form of an object where keys are usernames 
and values are arrays of other users nearby:

  const network = {
    'Min'     : ['William', 'Jayden', 'Omar'],
    'William' : ['Min', 'Noam'],
    'Jayden'  : ['Min', 'Amelia', 'Ren', 'Noam'],
    'Ren'     : ['Jayden', 'Omar'],
    'Amelia'  : ['Jayden', 'Adam', 'Miguel'],
    'Adam'    : ['Amelia', 'Miguel', 'Sofia', 'Lucas'],
    'Miguel'  : ['Amelia', 'Adam', 'Liam', 'Nathan'],
    'Noam'    : ['Nathan', 'Jayden', 'William'],
    'Omar'    : ['Ren', 'Min', 'Scott'],
    ...
  };

  For the network above, a message from Jayden to Adam should have this route:

    ['Jayden', 'Amelia', 'Adam']

    });

  // so there's NO path from startNode to endNode
